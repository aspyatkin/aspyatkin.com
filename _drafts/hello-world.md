Hello everyone! Let me introduce myself. My name is Alexander Pyatkin, I come from Samara, Russia.

I studied computer science and cybersecurity at [Samara State Aerospace University](http://www.ssau.ru/english/){:target="_blank"} and got a specialist degree in 2013. I also have a 1st dan in [Taekwon-Do ITF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Taekwon-Do_Federation){:target="_blank"}. I even used to work as an Taekwon-Do instructor! However, I make my living by designing software.

I work as a software engineer at [Indigo Byte Systems, LLC](http://indigobyte.com){:target="_blank"}. It's a small company with talented engineers. I've been working there since 2011, primarily on [Dr.Explain](http://drexplain.com){:target="_blank"} and [Tiwri.com](https://tiwri.com){:target="_blank"}. My area of expertise includes a wide variety of programming languages and technologies, such as C++, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Linux, Git, Chef.

Besides the projects at work, I maintain several projects on side. The most remarkable ones are those connected to [CTF](https://ctftime.org){:target="_blank"} contests organization - Themis Quals and Themis Finals. I am also known as one of the organizers of the annual cybersecurity CTF competition held in Samara - [VolgaCTF](https://volgactf.ru){:target="_blank"}.

I love the idea of the open-source software. To tell the truth, I try to open-source all the stuff I write in my spare time. You can check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/aspyatkin){:target="_blank"} and [my contributions list](https://aspyatkin.com/oss/).

One day I realized that it would be great to write down some notes about the projects I develop and ideas I come up with. Actually, I've been procrastinating for a long time before writing this first post.

Despite my native language is Russian, I've decided to write this post and the future ones in English. Firstly, English's the main language of IT. Secondly, as I'm eager to improve my English language skills, it would be a great practice.

More posts are about to come! Stay tuned!
